# Ecommerce-Follow-Along
Welcome to the **Ecommerce Follow Along Project**, this is a hands-on project where we will build a complete e-commerce application using the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, Node.js). The goal is to learn how to develop a full-stack web application step by step. 



## Milestone 1: Project Overview

#### 1. Understanding the MERN Stack:
**MongoDB :** A database for storinfg application data in flexible, document based format. 
**Express.js :** A backend web application framework for building APIs and handling server logics.
**React.js :** A framework library for building User Interfaces.
**Node.js :** A runtime environment that allows javascript to run on the server. 

#### 2. REST API Structure
REST APIs are used to allow communication between the frontend and backend. 
We'll Create APIs for: 
- **User Authentication**: Allowing users to register and login. 
- **Product Management**: Adding, updating and retrieving product data. 
- **Order Handling**: Managing customer orders. 

#### 3. Database Schema Design
We'll learn how to design and organize data using MongoDB. A Schema helps us define how the data is stores and related. 

#### 4. Authentication
Authentication ensures only the right people can access certain features. 
For example:
- Users need to login to place orders or see their personal data. 
- It keeps the app secure by verifying users' identities. 



## Milestone 2: Project Setup and Login Page Development

In this milestone, we set up the foundational structure for the project and implemented the first user-facing feature: the Login Page. Here's what we completed:

### 1. Project Folder Structure
We organized the project into two separate directories:
- Frontend: Where the React app lives.
- Backend: Where the Node.js/Express backend resides.

This structure will make it easier to manage the frontend and backend code separately as the project grows.

### 2. React Frontend Setup
We initialized a new React application to build the user interface. This app will be the foundation for all the user-facing features of the e-commerce platform.

### 3. Node.js Backend Setup
We set up a simple Node.js server using Express to handle requests and API routes. This server will eventually power the various features, like user authentication, product management, and order processing.

### 4. Tailwind CSS Configuration
Tailwind CSS was configured to enable a utility-first styling approach for rapid and responsive design. This allows us to quickly style components without writing custom CSS.

### 5. Login Page Development
The main feature developed in this milestone is the Login Page:
- A functional login form where users can enter their credentials to authenticate.
- Responsive and styled using Tailwind CSS to ensure a modern user experience.


## Milestone 3:
Set up dedicated folders for organizing backend code effectively. Initialized and configured a Node.js server to handle API requests. Connected
the application to MongoDB to store and manage data. Implemented basic error handling to ensure smooth server operation.


## Milestone 4:
Created a User Model to define how user data is structured in the database also developed a User Controller to manage user interactions, like
adding or retrieving data. Additionally, configured Multer to handle file uploads, allowing users to store files such as images.


##  Milestone 5: 
I built the Sign-Up page for user registration using HTML and CSS. I implemented form validation to ensure valid inputs, like email format and password security. This enhances user experience and prevents errors. All changes have been committed and pushed to the repository. 

## Milestone 6:
I created a backend signup API that securely stores user data. Passwords are encrypted using bcrypt before saving to MongoDB. The API ensures secure user authentication and data privacy. All changes are committed and pushed.

## Milestone 7
I implemented user login authentication by validating credentials and comparing encrypted passwords using bcrypt. The process involves retrieving user data, hashing the entered password, and matching it with the stored hash. If authenticated, access is granted; otherwise, an error is returned. This enhances security and protects user data. 

## Milestone 8
We created a reusable product card component and designed a homepage to display multiple cards dynamically. The component receives product details as props and is rendered using array mapping. This improves UI consistency, enhances user experience, and maintains an organized layout for showcasing products effectively. 

## Milestone 9
We created a product page for the e-commerce website. The page displays a list of products with their details, including images, names, descriptions, and prices. Users can click on a product to view more information or add it to their cart. This page provides a user-friendly interface for browsing and selecting products.

## Milestone 10 
We created an API to allow product creation with image uploads using Multer. The images are stored in the uploads/ directory, and product data, including image paths, is saved to MongoDB for efficient storage and retrieval.

## Milestone 11
We successfully fetched real-time product data from the backend and displayed it dynamically on the homepage. Additionally, we implemented an automatic image slider for each product, allowing multiple images to cycle every 3 seconds. This enhances user engagement and provides a more interactive browsing experience.

## Milestone 12
We implemented a ByProduct Page that displays products created by a specific email ID, while the Home Page continues to show all products.

## Milestone 13
We implemented the Update Product functionality, allowing users to edit product details. The update form dynamically loads the product's existing data, and changes are submitted via an API call. This ensures that users can modify product information easily while maintaining data integrity.

## Milestone 14 
This milestone focused on integrating the Delete Product functionality, allowing users to remove products permanently. A confirmation prompt ensures accidental deletions are avoided

## Milestone 15
Implement a responsive navigation bar using React and Tailwind CSS to enable smooth navigation between different pages in the application.

## Milestone 16
We create a product details page displaying all product data, including description, category, price, and tags, with quantity selection and an Add to Cart button

## Milestone 17
We implemented the backend functionality to add products to a cart and store them in the database. This feature allows users to add products to their cart, which persists in the database for future access

## Milestone 18
we implemented the backend functionality to add products to the user's cart and store them in the database.

## Milestone 19
we create an frontend page UI for cart and write an endpoint to increase and decrease the quantity of product inside cart

## Milestone 20
we will profile page frontend and write an endpoint to receive user data and display.
