# Ecommerce-Follow-Along
Welcome to the **Ecommerce Follow Along Project**, this is a hands-on project where we will build a complete e-commerce application using the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, Node.js). The goal is to learn how to develop a full-stack web application step by step. 



## Milestone 1: Project Overview

#### 1. Understanding the MERN Stack:
**MongoDB :** A database for storinfg application data in flexible, document based format. 
**Express.js :** A backend web application framework for building APIs and handling server logics.
**React.js :** A framework library for building User Interfaces.
**Node.js :** A runtime environment that allows javascript to run on the server. 

#### 2. REST API Structure
REST APIs are used to allow communication between the frontend and backend. 
We'll Create APIs for: 
- **User Authentication**: Allowing users to register and login. 
- **Product Management**: Adding, updating and retrieving product data. 
- **Order Handling**: Managing customer orders. 

#### 3. Database Schema Design
We'll learn how to design and organize data using MongoDB. A Schema helps us define how the data is stores and related. 

#### 4. Authentication
Authentication ensures only the right people can access certain features. 
For example:
- Users need to login to place orders or see their personal data. 
- It keeps the app secure by verifying users' identities. 



## Milestone 2: Project Setup and Login Page Development

In this milestone, we set up the foundational structure for the project and implemented the first user-facing feature: the Login Page. Here's what we completed:

### 1. Project Folder Structure
We organized the project into two separate directories:
- Frontend: Where the React app lives.
- Backend: Where the Node.js/Express backend resides.

This structure will make it easier to manage the frontend and backend code separately as the project grows.

### 2. React Frontend Setup
We initialized a new React application to build the user interface. This app will be the foundation for all the user-facing features of the e-commerce platform.

### 3. Node.js Backend Setup
We set up a simple Node.js server using Express to handle requests and API routes. This server will eventually power the various features, like user authentication, product management, and order processing.

### 4. Tailwind CSS Configuration
Tailwind CSS was configured to enable a utility-first styling approach for rapid and responsive design. This allows us to quickly style components without writing custom CSS.

### 5. Login Page Development
The main feature developed in this milestone is the Login Page:
- A functional login form where users can enter their credentials to authenticate.
- Responsive and styled using Tailwind CSS to ensure a modern user experience.


## Milestone 3:
Set up dedicated folders for organizing backend code effectively. Initialized and configured a Node.js server to handle API requests. Connected
the application to MongoDB to store and manage data. Implemented basic error handling to ensure smooth server operation.


## Milestone 4:
Created a User Model to define how user data is structured in the database also developed a User Controller to manage user interactions, like
adding or retrieving data. Additionally, configured Multer to handle file uploads, allowing users to store files such as images.
